    <p class="paragraph">The M36 tank destroyer, officially known as the 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage, M36, was an American armored vehicle employed during World War II. This tank destroyer combined the chassis of the M10 tank destroyer, utilizing the reliable chassis and drivetrain of the M4 Sherman, with sloped armor. It featured a new turret housing the powerful 90 mm gun M3. Introduced in 1943, the M36 entered combat in Europe in October 1944, gradually replacing the M10 tank destroyer. It also participated in the Korean War, demonstrating its capability to defeat the Soviet tanks deployed in that conflict. Some units were supplied to South Korea through the Military Assistance Program and remained in service for several years. Additionally, re-engined versions operated in Yugoslavia until the 1990s, while two remained in service with the Republic of China Army until at least 2001.

    <p class="paragraph">Although unofficially referred to as "Jackson," this nickname seems to have originated postwar and was never officially adopted by the U.S. Army.

    <p class="paragraph">rior to World War II, U.S. combined arms doctrine emphasized that tanks should be designed to penetrate enemy rear areas. GHQ tank battalions would assist infantry in eliminating entrenched enemy defenses, allowing armored divisions to exploit the breakthroughs and advance into the enemy's rear. While U.S. tanks were expected to engage any opposing tanks encountered during their offensive, countering large-scale enemy armored counterattacks was the responsibility of the Tank Destroyer Force. These tank destroyer units were designed to counter German blitzkrieg tactics, serving as a reserve at the corps or army level, ready to swiftly respond to any significant enemy tank breakthroughs. They employed aggressive maneuvering and ambush tactics, explicitly avoiding direct charges or pursuits of enemy tanks, to neutralize enemy armored threats. Consequently, there was a demand for fast and well-armed vehicles. Despite being equipped with turrets, unlike many self-propelled anti-tank guns of the era, American tank destroyers were typically more heavily armed but less armored, offering greater maneuverability than contemporary tanks. The strategy focused on leveraging speed and agility to deploy potent self-propelled anti-tank guns against enemy armored units.
