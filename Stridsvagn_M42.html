The Stridsvagn m/42 (Strv m/42) was a Swedish medium tank developed during World War II. Manufactured by AB Landsverk and initially known as Lago II-III-IV, it featured a 75 mm L/31 gun, marking the first time such a caliber was used in a Swedish tank. The tank was introduced to the Swedish Army in April 1943, with a total production of 282 units due to its modern design and mobility.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Sweden, being a neutral country during World War II, did not deploy its tanks in combat, so the Strv m/42 has no recorded battlefield history.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The Strv m/42 evolved from the Lago, a 16-tonne light tank armed with a Hungarian 37M 40 mm cannon and three machine guns, originally produced for the Hungarian Army in the late 1930s by AB Landsverk. This design was an extension of the earlier Stridsvagn L-60 light tank also produced by AB Landsverk. Responding to the Swedish Army's demand for a larger and more advanced tank than the Lago, the Strv m/42 (later known as Strv m/42 TM) was developed. This 22-tonne tank was equipped with a 75mm L/31 gun, capable of engaging both armored and soft targets. However, the m/42 TM faced gearbox issues, leading to modifications resulting in the m/42 TH and m/42 TV variants.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">In November 1941, an order was placed for 100 Strv m/42s with electromagnetic gearboxes (indicated by TM, where T stands for two engines and M for electromagnetic gearbox). In January 1942, an additional 60 tanks were ordered, produced under license by Volvo. The first 55 vehicles were powered by twin Scania-Vabis L/603 engines, while the remaining five featured the new Volvo A8B engine. These tanks were equipped with hydraulic gearboxes, leading to the designation changes to Strv m/42 EH (E for one engine and H for hydraulic gearbox) and Strv m/42 TH for dual-engine tanks with the new transmission. In June 1942, another order for 80 tanks was placed with Landsverk, consisting of 70 m/42 TH and 10 m/42 EH variants.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Between April 1943 and January 1945, a total of 282 Strv m/42 tanks were produced, with 180 manufactured by Landsverk and 102 by Volvo. Most of these tanks (225 units) were equipped with Scania engines, while the remaining 57 featured Volvo engines. Eventually, between 1957 and 1960, all Strv m/42 tanks with twin Scania-Vabis L/603 engines were rebuilt into Stridsvagn 74 tanks, while the EH variants with a single Volvo A8B engine were converted into Infanterikanonvagn 73 infantry support vehicles. The turrets of these tanks were repurposed as static gun emplacements, primarily defending harbors and occasionally airfields along major coastlines.
