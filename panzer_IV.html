    <p class="paragraph">The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV), sometimes known as the Panzer IV, is a German medium tank built in the late 1930s and widely utilized during WWII. Sd.Kfz. 161 was its ordnance inventory designation.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The Panzer IV was the most numerous German tank and the second-most numerous German completely tracked armoured combat vehicle of WWII, with 8,553 Panzer IVs of all variants constructed, only surpassed by the StuG III assault cannon, which had 10,086 units built. The chassis of the Sturmgeschütz IV assault cannon, the Jagdpanzer IV self-propelled anti-tank gun, the Wirbelwind self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, and the Brummbär self-propelled gun were all built on it.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The Panzer IV served in all of Germany's battle theaters and was the only German tank to stay in continuous production throughout the war. It was initially intended for infantry assistance, whilst the Panzer III was built to combat armoured fighting vehicles. However, as the Germans confronted the fearsome T-34, the Panzer IV, with a bigger turret ring to house more powerful weapons, changed duties with the Panzer III, whose manufacture ended in 1943. The Panzer IV received many upgrades and design changes to face new threats and extend its service life. In general, this entailed improving armour protection or modernizing armaments, however in the last months of the war, with Germany's desperate need for quick replacement of casualties, design improvements also included simplifications to speed up the production process.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The Panzer IV was largely replaced by the Panther medium tank, which was created to confront the Soviet T-34, although it remained an important component of German armoured divisions until the war's conclusion. With roughly 300 supplied to Finland, Romania, Spain, and Bulgaria, it was the most extensively exported tank in German service. Following the conflict, Syria acquired Panzer IVs from France and Czechoslovakia, which were used in the 1967 Six-Day War.
