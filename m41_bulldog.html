    <p class="paragraph">The Walker Bulldog, as the name suggests, was designed for armed reconnaissance with 76mm cannons. It was manufactured by Cadillac between 1951 and 1954 and was sold to the United States Army as a replacement for their obsolete M24 Chaffee tanks from World War II. The M41's weight and weaponry made it effective for fast airborne deployments and close infantry support as well as reconnaissance. When they originally entered US service, all M41s were dubbed Little Bulldog. They were later dubbed Walker Bulldog after General Walton Walker, who died in a Jeep accident in 1950. Following World War II, the M41 was the first light tank to be sold to Asia in substantial quantities.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">As the Korean War erupted, the US Army's heightened need for tanks caused a rush to produce the M41. Technical difficulties, along with the rather confined proportions of its hull interior, gave it a bad reputation among American tank operators due to its hasty initial manufacture. It was also deemed too big for reconnaissance in contrast to the Chaffee. The M41 program's funding was reduced proportionately, and greater attention was placed on the construction of new main battle tanks like the M47 Patton. Cadillac stopped making the M41A1 in late 1954. During the 1960s, it was superseded by the M551 Sheridan. </p>
