    <p class="paragraph">The Carro Veloce 33 (CV 33), also known as L3/33, was an Italian tankette introduced in 1933 and utilized by the Italian Army during World War II. It was inspired by the British Carden Loyd tankette, which Italy produced under license as the CV 29. Many CV 33s underwent modifications to align with the CV 35 specifications in 1935. Subsequently, in 1938, the CV 33 was redesignated as "L3/33," while the CV 35 was renamed "L3/35."
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The original L3/33 featured a two-man crew protected by 12 mm of welded armor and was armed with a single 6.5 mm machine gun.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The L3/33 was deployed in various theaters of war, including China, Spain, France, the Balkans, North Africa, Italian East Africa, Italy, and Russia.
</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The L3/33 CC (Contro Carro, meaning "Anti Tank") variant was derived from the L3 tankette. A limited number of L3/33s and 35s had their 6.5mm machine guns replaced with a Fucile Controcarri S Mod.39 (20 mm) anti-tank gun, transforming them into makeshift tank destroyers. These modified tankettes arrived too late to participate in combat in Libya but saw limited action in Tunisia in late 1942.
</p>
    <p class=paragraph>In 1935, development commenced on the "L3 Lf" (Lancia fiamme, meaning "flamethrower") flame tank, based on the L3 tankette. One of the machine guns was replaced with a flamethrower nozzle, and the fuel was stored in an armored trailer towed behind the vehicle. Later versions featured the fuel stored in a box-shaped tank mounted above the L3's engine compartment. Weighing 3.2 tons, the armored trailer carried 500 liters (110 imp gal; 130 US gal) of fuel. While its effective range is cited at 40 m (130 ft) by some sources, others claim a range of 100 m (330 ft). Although deployed in North Africa, there is no documented evidence of their involvement in combat there.
